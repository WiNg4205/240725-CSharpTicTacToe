# 30/07/24 - C# TicTacToe (#6)
This is a tictactoe game implemented in C#. The opponent is a bot which randomises the square to it takes. 

This is my first C# program I have made. My first impression is that it is very similar to Java. This is quite a basic program so I didn't get to play around with unique features. Hence, the limited takeaways.
